Studying purposes and intensions.

Just now I am learning flex properties. 
Have a problem with wraping( Element aside, under h2 TEA OF THE MONTH, class aside-item ). It is not sits as in Code Cademy example, but I am still working on it and I do not give it up. It is not so hard just more learn and try. Also apply all my brain cells to achieve satisfaction. ,D
